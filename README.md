nat-js
======

A NLP (natural language processing) toolkit in javascript.

nat-js is a small toolkit which will help you apply some NLP techniques in javascript. With nat-js you will be able to tokenize, calculate frequency distribution, apply some algorithms to string comparison and make syllable splitting.

NOTE: nat-js is designed to work on the portuguese language. If you liked it, you could help extend it to other languages.

Tests and examples
------------------

The test.htm file can be run locally, there's no need to copy it to a webserver. I've tried to coverage all of the api on it and you can learn how each class and each method works and must be called.

The nat.htm file <b>must</b> be copied to a webserver since you cannot download the data file when on file:// protocol. It demonstrates how a text can be tokenized and how to process the result.

The test-frequencies.htm file <b>must</b> be copied to a webserver since you cannot download the data file when on file:// protocol. It demonstrates how to analyze frequency distribution of tokens, syllables, chars and word length.
